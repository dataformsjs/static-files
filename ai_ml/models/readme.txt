File [pima-indians-diabetes.sklearn] was generated by script:
	https://github.com/dataformsjs/website/blob/master/scripts/ai-ml-pima-indians-diabetes-build.py

[pima-indians-diabetes.sklearn] uses Python pickle format and was originally created using sklearn version 0.21.3

As of version 0.24.1 the pickle file cannot be loaded so the model was converted to JSON format.
